<!-- Summary
====== -->

The idea was to leverage pedestrian-vehicle interaction at road intersections, to induce a ‘passive-aggressive’ behavior in autonomous vehicles. For this, I employ Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) on a 'reasonable' car profile, in order to learn pedestrain behavior. This learned model explains the pedestrain's motion relative to the car's movement. This project was motivated by Dorsa Sadigh's work on human-aware autonomous cars (see [1](http://iliad.stanford.edu/pdfs/publications/sadigh2016information.pdf), [2](http://iliad.stanford.edu/pdfs/publications/sadigh2016planning.pdf), [3](http://iliad.stanford.edu/pdfs/publications/sadigh2018verifying.pdf)).

To get into the details, I first used Deep-Q Networks (DQN) on random pedestrian profiles to learn a car behavior. I then recovered the pedestrian utility by training IRL methods on the learned car model. On learning this pedestrain model, I observed that the pedestrian backs off and waits before proceeding. The car would then accelerate/decelerate accordingly, which is the desired behavior.

I employed MILA Labs' [Duckietown](https://www.duckietown.org/) for rendering the models. A short summary of the preliminary results is available [here](https://prabhasak.github.io/files/CarPed_DQN.pdf). The project codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/prabhasak/chicken).
