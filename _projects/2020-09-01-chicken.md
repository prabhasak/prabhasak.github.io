<!-- Summary
====== -->

The goal is to leverage pedestrian-vehicle interaction at road intersections, to induce a ‘passive-aggressive’ behavior in autonomous vehicles. I used Deep-Q Networks (DQN) on random pedestrian profiles to learn a car behavior and used Inverse Reinforcement Learning on the learned car model to recover a pedestrian utility. I employed MILA Labs' [Duckietown](https://www.duckietown.org/) for rendering the models. 

On learning this pedestrain model, I observed that the pedestrian backs off & waits before proceeding. The car would then accelerate/decelerate accordingly. A short summary of results is available [here](https://prabhasak.github.io/files/CarPed_DQN.pdf). The project codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/prabhasak/chicken).
