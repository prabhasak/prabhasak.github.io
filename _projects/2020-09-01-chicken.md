Summary
======

We leverage pedestrian-vehicle interaction at road intersections, to induce a ‘passive-aggressive’ behavior in autonomous vehicles. We used Deep-Q Networks on pedestrian profiles to learn a car behavior and Inverse Reinforcement Learning with the learned car behavior to recover pedestrian utility.

On learning a pedestrain model based on the car model, we observed that the pedestrian backs off & waits before proceeding. The car would then accelerates/decelerate accordingly. Employed MILA Labs' [Duckietown](https://www.duckietown.org/) for simulations. A short summary of results is available [here](https://prabhasak.github.io/files/CarPed_DQN.pdf).
