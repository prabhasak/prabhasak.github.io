Description
======
The idea is to develop sample efficient Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning algorithms using human priors, for solving complex, hierarchical, sparse environments, with constraints on training time and compute.

More specifically, the goal is to obtain a Diamond object in Minecraft using the [MineRL](https://minerl.io/docs/) datatset and Microsoft’s [Malmo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-malmo/) simulator.

This is a work in collaboration with my labmates, so I am unable to share a link to the project's GitHub repository. Please feel free to reach me if you would like a sneak-peek into the codebase!
