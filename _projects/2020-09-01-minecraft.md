Description
======

<div style="text-align: justify">

The goal is to develop sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning algorithms using human demonstrations, to perform tasks in Minecraft. The MineRL competition involves solving tasks in complex, hierarchical, sparse environments, with constraints on training time and compute. This necessitates the use of efficient exploration techniques and training with human priors. To address this, we used Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations (DQfD) for learning behaviors, which is essentially an RL algorithm paired with demonstration data from the <a href="https://minerl.io/docs/">MineRL</a> dataset. <br><br>

Specifically, we used DQfD for learning to chop trees and mine diamonds in Minecraft. as opposed to learning behavior purely from RL. For the task of chopping trees, RL algorithms trained on demonstrations (DQfD) performed 10x better than the plain RL equivalent of Deep-Q Networks (DQN). Details of the project are available as part of my thesis defense and can be accessed <a href="https://prabhasak.github.io/files/Thesis_final.pdf">here</a> (from slide 79). This is work in progress for a competition, so I am unable to share the codebase. However, it should be publicly accessible <a href="https://github.com/prabhasak/masters-thesis">here</a> by Jan 1, 2021. Please feel free to reach me if you would like a sneak-peek :)
