Description
======

<div style="text-align: justify">

This is a collection of the classification algorithms I implemented as part of the Machine Learning course at Texas A&M. To touch upon them briefly, I compared Bayes, k-NN classifiers on the Iris dataset, giving a 99% accuracy on the dataset. I also implemented the SVM, Neural Network classifiers on MNIST and medical datasets such as fMRI, EEG recordings. Here, I improved accuracy over SVMs (sigmoid/RBF kernels, 93%) using NNs (3 layers, Adam, batch norm, 96%). As a side-exercise, I used the Stanford CS-231n course implementation of CNN to obtain a 75% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Detailed description of the problems, experiments, and the codebase is available <a href="https://github.com/prabhasak/supervised">here</a>.
