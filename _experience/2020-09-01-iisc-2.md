Short summary
======
This project addressed the problem of routing and task-scheduling of robots for simultaneous pickup and delivery of goods, in simulation. We compared the performance of metaheuristic algorithms on Vehicle Routing problem (VRP) variants. We applied Genetic and Greedy algorithm to Capacitated VRP and VRP with time windows. We demonstrated a 2x reduction in the traversal, hence energy consumption, of 12 vehicles to pick and deliver goods at 50 locations. The experiments were coded in Python 3.0.
