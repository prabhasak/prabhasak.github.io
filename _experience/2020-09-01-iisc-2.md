Short summary
======
This project addressed the problem of routing and task-scheduling of robots for simultaneous pickup and delivery of goods. We compared the performance of metaheuristic algorithms used in the Vehicle Routing problem. We demonstrated a reduction in robot’s traversal, hence energy consumption. The experiments were performed using Python 3.0. Slides for the project can be found [here](https://prabhasak.github.io/files/Robot_indoor_routing_7.pdf).
