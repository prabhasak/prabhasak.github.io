<b>Hi there!</b> I am an engineering graduate and work in the Supply Chain Industry as a Business Processes Consultant at SAP America Inc. in Philadelphia, PA, USA. At SAP, I dabble in the areas of demand, inventory, and supply planning and work directly with our customers to design, implement, and configure their supply chain as per their requirements through SAP's Integrated Business Planning tool. <br><br>

I have an academic background in Machine Learning (Reinforcement Learning) and am fascinated by its ever-growing applications, even more so with the advent of the GenAI hype ("What a time to be alive!"). Explore the <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/experience">Experience</a> and <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/projects">Projects</a> pages for more info. A pdf link to my resume is <a href="https://prabhasak.github.io/files/Resume_Prabhasa_Kalkur.pdf"><b>here</b></a> (updated July 2022). <br><br>

<b>Outside work,</b> I am a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/prabhasa/">cinephile</a>, <a href="https://www.tvtime.com/en/user/57933524/profile">telephile</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/prabhasa">animangaphile</a>, and a devout <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Scratchpad.IGSA/photos/a.534487949954447/2212542242149001/">memer</a> (that's me as a GoT S8 reference). I also like to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FruobYpsu3Gxoshk8">travel</a> and have had the fortune of visiting 5/195 countries, 33/50 U.S. states, 35/63 U.S. National Parks (as of July 2024). My dream destinations are Japan (anime!) and Switzerland. <br><br>

Here is a Graduate Student <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/talesattamu/">series</a> I started and an <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2019/05/balancing-engineering-and-creativity.html">article</a> written by the University during my shenanigans at Texas A&M. Among other things that I like, I am looking to catch up on some reading and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/315huxqcj3bimm6b7xmhgz5ubunq?si=3fdf90eb18b74400">music</a> over the coming years! <br><br>

<b>Philosophy:</b> I am a huge fan of One Piece, arguably the greatest fictional story ever told. I am forever inspired by and strive to live 'like a Pirate King.' This goes back to a <a href="https://youtu.be/UyhrIZsclb0?si=KeizIpwRCiUN_LOF&t=54">quote</a> by the protagonist "I donâ€™t want to conquer anything. I just think the person with the most freedom in this whole ocean, is THE PIRATE KING !!!" <br><br>
