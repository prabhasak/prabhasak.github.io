<b>Hi there!</b> I am an engineering graduate and dabble in the Supply Chain space as a Consultant at SAP America Inc., based out of the United States. I work with customers to design, integrate, and configure their networks with SAP's Integrated Business Planning solution. Here, I have had the opportunity to collaborate on projects across several industries, to note a few: pharmaceuticals (Johnson & Johnson), auto parts (General Motors), energy (Suncor), consumer goods (Alicorp), and beverages (The Coca-Cola Company). <br><br>
<!-- Suncor (integration), Alicorp (demand), J&J (inventory), GM (time-series based supply planning), and The Coca-Cola Company (order-based supply planning) -->

Prior to SAP, I graduated with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University, specializing in Machine Learning. I have since been fascinated by its ever-growing applications in both supply chain planning and outside. Explore the <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/experience">Experience</a> and <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/projects">Projects</a> pages for more info. A pdf link to my resume (updated July 2022) is <a href="https://prabhasak.github.io/files/Resume_Prabhasa_Kalkur.pdf">here</a>. <br><br>

<b>Philosophy:</b> I am a huge fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece">One Piece</a>, arguably the greatest fictional story ever told. I am forever inspired by and strive to live life 'like a Pirate King.' This goes back to a <a href="https://youtu.be/UyhrIZsclb0?si=KeizIpwRCiUN_LOF&t=54">quote</a> by the protagonist: "I donâ€™t want to conquer anything. I just think the person with the most freedom (in this whole ocean), is THE PIRATE KING !!!" <br><br>
