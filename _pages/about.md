<!-- Hi there! I am a Graduate student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station. I am passionate about Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL) and its steadily growing area of applications to self-driving cars, robotics, and games. I have also developed recent interest in data analysis & visualization, on using tools like Tableau and Tidyverse. I am graduating this Fall with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering, and am open to opportunities as a Software Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer. <br><br> -->

<!-- Since last summer, I have worked with -->
<!-- [Dileep Kalathil](http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/). -->
<!-- <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/">Dr. Dileep Kalathil</a> on projects that aim to learn behaviors of simulated real-world systems such as autonomous vehicles and video games. For my Thesis, I used sample-efficient imitation learning methods to learn behaviors of two sparsely-rewarded systems, using human demonstrations of the tasks involved. Prior to joining A&M, I was a project assistant for two years at the Indian Institute of Science, India. More details can be found on the <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/experience">Experience</a> and <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/projects">Projects</a> pages. A pdf link to my resume can be found <a href="https://prabhasak.github.io/files/Resume_Prabhasa_Kalkur.pdf">here</a>. <br><br> -->

<!-- Here, I worked with Dr. Chandra Murthy on addressing the uncertainty in indoor device self-localization, and with Dr. Navin Kashyap on the problem of routing robots for simultaneous pickup & delivery of items. <br><br> -->

Hi there! I am a graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University. My research with Dr. Dileep Kalathil used Machine Learning (ML) methods to learn behaviors of complex systems using human demos in a sample-efficient manner (<a href="https://prabhasak.github.io/files/E3-Masters_Thesis_Prabhasa_Kalkur.pdf">Thesis</a>, <a href="https://prabhasak.github.io/files/E3-Masters_Thesis_Prabhasa_Kalkur_Slides.pdf">Slides</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/472405835">Video</a>). I am passionate about Deep Reinforcement Learning and its impact on the automation industry (self-driving cars, robotics, and games). <br><br>

I graduated in Dec 2020 with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering, and am currently working as an Intern at SAP's Center of Excellence (CoE). At SAP, I am looking at developing optimizers and ML models that learn to find patterns in day-to-day activites in our customers' product supply chain. I am familiar with algorithms and frameworks for machine learning and reinforcement learning, and do most of my programming in Python. I have also developed a recent interest in data science & visualization, familizarizing myself with related tools such as SQL, Tableau. Prior to joining A&M, I worked on interesting research problems at the Indian Institute of Science, India.
