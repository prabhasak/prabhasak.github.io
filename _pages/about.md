<div style="text-align: justify">

Hi there! I am a Graduate student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station. I am passionate about Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep-RL) and its steadily growing area of applications to real-world systems like self-driving cars, robotics, and games. I will be graduating this Fall with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering, and am open to job opportunities as a Machine Learning Software Engineer. <br><br>

Since last summer, I have been part of the Laboratory for Embedded & Networked Sensor Systems at Texas A&M University, working with Dr.
<!-- [Dileep Kalathil](http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/). -->
<a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/">Dileep Kalathil</a>. My Thesis work is on studying the sample-efficiency of an imitation learning algorithm for two use cases: autonomous UAV maneuver & landing, and obtaining a Diamond object on Minecraft. Prior to joining A&M, I was a project assistant for two years at the Indian Institute of Science, India. More details can be found on the <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/experience">Experience</a> and <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/projects">Projects</a> pages. <br><br>

<!-- Here, I worked with Dr. Chandra Murthy on addressing the uncertainty in indoor device self-localization, and with Dr. Navin Kashyap on the problem of routing robots for simultaneous pickup & delivery of items. <br><br> -->
