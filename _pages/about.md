<!-- For my work, I use Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to learn profit-maximizing plans.
Prior to joining A&M, I worked on interesting research problems at the Indian Institute of Science, India.  -->

<b>Hi there!</b> I am an engineering graduate and work in the Supply Chain Industry as a Business Process Consultant at SAP America Inc. in Philadelphia, PA, USA. I have a background in Machine Learning and am fascinated by its ever-growing applications to automation. Explore the <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/experience">Experience</a> and <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/projects">Projects</a> pages for more info. A pdf link to my resume is <a href="https://prabhasak.github.io/files/Resume_Prabhasa_Kalkur.pdf"><b>here</b></a>. <br><br>

<b>Outside work,</b> I am a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/prabhasa/">cinephile</a>, <a href="https://www.tvtime.com/en/user/57933524/profile">telephile</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/prabhasa">animangaphile</a>, and a devout <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Scratchpad.IGSA/photos/a.534487949954447/2212542242149001/">memer</a> (that's me in a GoT S8 reference). I also like to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FruobYpsu3Gxoshk8">travel</a> (5/195 countries, 22/50 U.S. states, 30/63 U.S. National Parks as of July 2023). <br><br>

Miscellaneous plug: A Graduate Student <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/talesattamu/">series</a> I made and an <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2019/05/balancing-engineering-and-creativity.html">article</a> on my shenanigans at A&M. <br><br>
