<b>Hi there!</b> I am an engineering graduate based out of the United States and dabble in the Supply Chain Planning space as a Consultant at SAP America Inc. I work with customers to design, integrate, and configure their supply chain processes with SAP's Integrated Business Planning solution. Here, I have had the opportunity to collaborate on projects across several industries, to note a few: pharmaceuticals (Johnson & Johnson), auto parts (General Motors), energy (Suncor), consumer goods (Lamb Weston, Alicorp, IFF), and beverages (The Coca-Cola Company). <br><br>
<!-- Suncor (integration), Alicorp (demand), J&J (inventory), GM (time-series based supply planning), and The Coca-Cola Company (order-based supply planning) -->

Prior to SAP, I graduated with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University, specializing in Reinforcement Learning. I have since been fascinated by Generative AI's ever-growing applications in supply chain planning.

During my days at Texas A&M, I sketched a Graduate Student <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/talesattamu/">series</a> and featured in an <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2019/05/balancing-engineering-and-creativity.html">article</a> by the university.</li>

<b>Philosophy:</b> I have been a life-long fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece">One Piece</a>, arguably the greatest fictional story ever told (<a href="https://youtu.be/P74f-QH6_R8">how One Piece is shaping a generation of protests</a>). I strive to achieve the simplicity, genuineness, childlike wonder, and relentless optimism of the protagonist Luffy and am inspired by his philosophy to live life 'like a Pirate King.' This goes back to a question "can you really conquer these terrifying seas (and become the Pirate King)?" and Luffy's <a href="https://youtu.be/UyhrIZsclb0?si=KeizIpwRCiUN_LOF&t=54">response</a>: "I don’t want to conquer anything. I think the person with the most freedom (in the seas), is the Pirate King!" <br><br>
