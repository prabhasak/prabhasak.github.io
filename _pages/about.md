<div style="text-align: justify">

Hi there! I am a Graduate student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station. I am passionate about Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL) and its steadily growing area of applications to self-driving cars, robotics, and games. I am also interested in data analysis and visualization, with recent interest in tools like Tableau and Tidyverse. I am graduating this Fall with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering, and am open to job opportunities as a Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and/or Data Scientist. <br><br>

Since last summer, I have worked with
<!-- [Dileep Kalathil](http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/). -->
<a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/">Dr. Dileep Kalathil</a> on projects that aim to learn behaviors of simulated real-world systems such as autonomous vehicles and video games. For my Thesis, I used sample-efficient imitation learning methods to learn behaviors of two sparsely-rewarded systems, using human demonstrations of the tasks involved. Prior to joining A&M, I was a project assistant for two years at the Indian Institute of Science, India. More details can be found on the <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/experience">Experience</a> and <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/projects">Projects</a> pages. <br><br>

<!-- Here, I worked with Dr. Chandra Murthy on addressing the uncertainty in indoor device self-localization, and with Dr. Navin Kashyap on the problem of routing robots for simultaneous pickup & delivery of items. <br><br> -->
