<b>Hi there!</b> I am an engineering graduate and work in the Supply Chain space as a Business Processes Consultant at SAP America Inc. in the United States. I dabble in Supply Chain Planning solutions, particularly demand, inventory, and supply planning. I work directly with customers to design, integrate, and configure their supply chain networks with the help of SAP's Integrated Business Planning (IBP) tool. <br><br>

In my role at SAP, I have had the opportunity to implement projects and PoCs for industries such as pharmaceuticals (J&J), auto & parts (GM), energy (Suncor), consumer goods (Alicorp), and beverages (The Coca-Cola Company). In the advent of the Gen-AI era, I also look forward to working closely with our in-house Joule AI for SAP IBP. <br><br>
<!-- Suncor (integration), Alicorp (demand), J&J (inventory), GM (time-series based supply planning), and The Coca-Cola Company (order-based supply planning) -->

Prior to SAP, I graduated with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University, specializing with a Thesis in Reinforcement Learning. I have since been fascinated by its ever-growing applications in both supply chain planning and outside.

<b>Philosophy:</b> I am a huge fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece">One Piece</a>, arguably the greatest fictional story ever told. I am forever inspired by and strive to live life 'like a Pirate King.' This goes back to a <a href="https://youtu.be/UyhrIZsclb0?si=KeizIpwRCiUN_LOF&t=54">quote</a> by the protagonist: "I donâ€™t want to conquer anything. I just think the person with the most freedom (in this whole ocean), is THE PIRATE KING !!!" <br><br>
