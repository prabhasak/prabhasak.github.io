<!-- For my work, I use Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to learn profit-maximizing plans.
Prior to joining A&M, I worked on interesting research problems at the Indian Institute of Science, India.  -->

Hi there! I am an engineering graduate with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University. I have a background in Machine Learning and am fascinated by its applications automation. Currently, I work in the Supply Chain Industry as a Business Process Consultant at SAP America Inc. in Pennsylvania, USA. Check out the <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/experience">Experience</a> and <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/projects">Projects</a> pages for more details. A pdf link to my resume can be found <a href="https://prabhasak.github.io/files/Resume_Prabhasa_Kalkur.pdf"><b>here</b></a>. <br><br>

Outside work, I spend most of my time as a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/prabhasa/">cinephile</a>, <a href="https://www.tvtime.com/en/user/57933524/profile">telephile</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/prabhasa">animangaphile</a>, and a devout <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Scratchpad.IGSA/photos/a.534487949954447/2212542242149001/">memer</a> (GoT reference). I am also a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FruobYpsu3Gxoshk8">travel</a> enthusiast (5/195 countries, 19/50 U.S. states, 21/63 U.S. National Parks). Check out my Graduate Student <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/talesattamu/">series</a> and an <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2019/05/balancing-engineering-and-creativity.html">article</a> on my shenanigans at Texas A&M University. <br><br>
