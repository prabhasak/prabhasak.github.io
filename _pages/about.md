<!-- For my work, I use Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to learn profit-maximizing plans.
Prior to joining A&M, I worked on interesting research problems at the Indian Institute of Science, India.  -->

Hi there! I am an engineering graduate with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University. I am curious about Machine Learning (ML) and its contribution to advancements in automation, specifically self-driving cars, robotics, and games. Currently, I work as a Support Engineer at SAP's Center of Expertise (CoE) in Pennsylvania, USA. Here, I help develop custom apps that provide statistical forecasting for our supply chain customers. More details about my experience can be found on the <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/experience">Experience</a> and <a href="http://prabhasak.github.io/projects">Projects</a> pages. A pdf link to my resume can be found <a href="https://prabhasak.github.io/files/Resume_Prabhasa_Kalkur.pdf"><b>here</b></a>.  <br><br>

I spend most of my awake time as a [cinephile](https://letterboxd.com/prabhasa/), [telephile](https://www.tvtime.com/en/user/57933524/profile), [mangaphile](https://myanimelist.net/profile/prabhasa), and a devout [memer](https://www.facebook.com/Scratchpad.IGSA/photos/a.534487949954447/2212542242149001/) (GoT reference). I am also a [travel](https://goo.gl/maps/FruobYpsu3Gxoshk8) enthusiast looking forward to the post-COVID world (5 countries, 18 U.S. states, 20+ U.S. National Parks and counting...). Check out my Graduate Student [series](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/talesattamu/) and an [article](https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2019/05/balancing-engineering-and-creativity.html) on my shenanigans at Texas A&M University. <br><br>

More about my education and profession: My Master's research used Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to learn complex behaviors from human demos (<a href="https://prabhasak.github.io/files/E3-Masters_Thesis_Prabhasa_Kalkur.pdf">Thesis</a>, <a href="https://prabhasak.github.io/files/E3-Masters_Thesis_Prabhasa_Kalkur_Slides.pdf">Slides</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/472405835">Video</a>). Now, as part of the logistics planning & procurement team at SAP America, I help develop ML models in the SAP ecosystem that helps customers optimize their supply chain demand planning. With dynamic recommendations from the ML models, customers can come up with cost-effective plans for production. I am familiar with algorithms and frameworks for ML/RL, and do most of my programming in Python. I have also developed a recent interest in data science & visualization, familizarizing myself with related tools. <br><br>
